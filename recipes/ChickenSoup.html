            <ol>

                    Make the stock by boiling the chicken and veggies until the meat is falling off the bone.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove the chicken and cut into pieces (discard skin and bones).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Strain the vegetables (reserving the stock) and cut into pieces. Rinse the pot.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Return everything to the pot. Heat the soup through and season to taste.
